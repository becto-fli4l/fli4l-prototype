/**
 * Creates an empty hash map. A hash map manages a collection of entries which

 * entry is typically a structure containing one member being the key.
 *
 * @param key_offset
 *  The offset pointing to the key within the entry structure. Use the
 *  offsetof() macro to compute it, e.g. use offsetof(struct sometype_t,key) if
 *  the structure type sometype_t contains a member "key" which is to be used
 *  as the key for the hash map.
 * @param num_buckets
 *  The number of buckets to use. The larger the value, the smaller the risk of
 *  hash collisions (more than one entry in a bucket) but the larger the memory
 *  footprint. It follows that it is sensible to choose a value that is equal
 *  to the estimated number of entries the hash table will hold. This value may
 *  not be zero.
 * @param hash
 *  A pointer to the hash function to be used. It may not be NULL.
 * @param cmp
 *  A pointer to the function to be used for key comparison. It may not be NULL.
 * @param destroy
 *  A pointer to the function destroying entries when they are replaced or
 *  removed from the map. It constitutes some sort of an entry destructor. If
 *  NULL, nothing is done when an entry goes away.
 * @return
 *  A pointer to the hash map.
