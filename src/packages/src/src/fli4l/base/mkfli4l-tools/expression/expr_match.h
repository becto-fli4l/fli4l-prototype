/**
 * Creates a regular expression matching expression. Such an expression tries
 * to match a string against a regular expression. If evaluation succeeds,
 * the subexpressions that were matched are stored in the array MATCH_%.
 * Otherwise, FALSE is returned.
 *
 * Note that if storing subexpressions fails or any other error occurs while
 * evaluating a regular expression matching expression, an error value is
 * returned.
 *
 * Note that no subexpressions behind the first subexpression which has not
 * been matched are stored. That means that matching "a(bc)*(d)" with "ad" will
 * result in MATCH_N being 0 as the first subexpression has not been matched at
 * all. However, if a subexpression is matched by the empty string, it is
 * recorded, so matching "a(b*)(d)" with "ad" will set MATCH_N to 2, MATCH_1 to
 * the empty string, and MATCH_2 to "d".
 *
 * Note that references pointing to other variable types as in "a(RE:NUMERIC)b"
 * count as subexpressions.
 *
 * @param scope
 *  The scope this expression lives in.
 * @param arg
 *  The argument to match. Ownership is transferred to the expression.
 * @param regex
 *  The regular expression to match against.
 * @return
 *  A pointer to a dynamically allocated expression.
