# READER/WRITER LOCKS #
#######################
# Reader/writer locks offer fine-grained locking depending on the type of
# operation to be performed on the protected data. Read locks are shared and
# allow an unlimited number of processes to access the protected data in
# parallel for reading. Write locks are exclusive and allow exactly one process
# to access the protected data for writing while all other processes have to
# wait. Writers are preferred, i.e. if a writer wants to acquire a write lock,
# subsequent readers are forced to wait until the writer has acquired (and
# later released) the lock. This avoids writer starvation but it relies on the
# fact that read operations are frequent and write operations are infrequent.
# If a process has acquired a read lock, it can later try to acquire the write
# lock. This only works if all other readers have released their read lock and
# is called lock promotion. If two readers holding a read lock want to promote
# their lock to a write lock, a deadlock occurs. To prevent this, a
# reader/writer lock must always be guarded by another exclusive lock which is
# acquired and released around the code that may want to promote the lock. This
# additional exclusive lock ensures that a lock promotion is only possible if
# at most one process holds a read lock.
