2.1.0:
------
17.02.2002 tobig
    - changed syntax of masq-module loading (again ;-) ) and added a lot of
      documentation about it
20.02.2002 rr
    - changed etc/rc.d/eth so that 8390.o and pci-scan.o will be loaded
      if they exist and not only when they are defined as ethernet-driver
    - changed config/base.txt: removed driver-names 8390 and pci-scan
      because this files are automatically copied onto the disk when
      necessary by opt/base.txt

21.02.2002 hs

    - added original rtl8139.o as rtl8139-orig.o
04.03.2002 jw5
    - Added regular expressions to check process, see developer documentation
      (unfortunatly only in german at this point in time)
    - added opt/base.exp which contains the basic regexps
    - remove special handling of base, dsl, isdn and replace it with a more
      general concept
    - remove special handling of eth_drv_n, scsi_drv_n and isdn_type and
      use a more general concept
    - standalone tool regexp added which can be used to develop regular
      expressions and provides a nice introduction to regexps
    - base/doc/dev/regexp.txt added which describes the new check process
      and regular expression
    - opt/package.txt adjusted to new file format (see base/doc/dev/opt.txt)
05.03.2002 jw5
    - use *_% variables instead of *_N variables in opt/package.txt to stay
      conform with the format used by check/package.txt
    - added some new regexp checks in check/base.txt as an example of regexp
      usage:

            MOUNT_OPT           -         -            RE:ro|rw|no
            PART_OPT            -         -            PARTITION
            UPDATE_MODE         -         -            RE:add|cfg|full|none

06.03.2002 jw5
    - fix bug in *_% variable handling. Files depending on these
      variables have been added to zip list regardless of the contents
      of the opt variable thei were depending on.

    - fix a bug with short opt names (e.g. e3); we accidently didn't
      copy any files depending on short opt names

    - doc changes:

      - base/doc/dev/opt.txt: added remarks about new opt/package.txt
      format and reference to regexp.txt for check/package.txt files
      - base/doc/dev/regexp.txt: new file describing the usage of
      regular expression within check/package.txt

07.03.2002 jw5
    - Added weak declaration for external symbols.

    If a packet references an externally defined variable, it may
    happen that the package defining this variable isn't present. This
    would trigger an error message in mkfli4l which expects to find
    all variables referenced by opt/package.txt.

    To handle this situation package developers can add a
    "weak"-declaration for external variables. It has the following
    format:

    opt/package.txt:

            weak        variable    -

    This introduces the variable to mkfli4l if its not already present
    and will set it to 'undefined'. If its necessary we may use the
    third field to introduce default values. The infrastructure is
    already there.

11.03.2002 jw5
    - added better check facility (see documentation)

13.03.2002 jw5

    mkfli4l schreibt nun zusätzlich eine volle rc-config nach
    img/full_rc.cfg. Dort sind Variablen, die nicht in die eigentliche
    rc.cfg übernommen wurden, mit einem vorangestellten "# "
    gekennzeichnet.  Damit kann man leichter überprüfen, ob man seine
    check/package.txt richtig geschrieben hat.  Tauchen in der vollen
    rc.cfg auskommentierte Variablen auf, die eigentlich aktiv sein
    sollten, hat man in der check/package.txt Datei was falsch
    gemacht.

16.03.2002 rr
    - modified etc/rcd./route and circuit to set router quietly because
      of an error-message when the routes are already set.

18.03.2002 rr
    - IP_ETH_X_NETWORK now obsolete

19.03.2002 jw5
    - .*_DO_DEBUG-variables are always exported now
    - introduced foreach to be able to iterate over %-variables
    - introduced special meaning for '$' and '%' in strings
    - updated documentation

20.03.2002 hs
    - removed ide-drivers from kernel

21.03.2002 rr
    - updated rootfs /dev nodes
      - removed hd[a-d][8-15]
      - added hd[e-h][0-7], sd[a-d][0-7], scd[0-3]

24.3.2002 jw5
    - check whether % variable is actually used before copying a file
      depending on it

27.3.2002 jw5
    - use 0.0.0.0 if no remote ip is specified. This prevents
      ifconfig from generating routes while bringing up the interfaces.

29.03.2002 hs
    - renamed many startup-files, changed rootfs for new startup-concept
    - following changes in rootfs.gz:
        deleted /var/log/wtmp,/var/rum/utmp and /var/run/|printer
        moved /dev/msys/fla* dev /dev/fla*
        deleted symlink /dev/cdrom
        /etc/rc doesn't call rc.local any more. /etc/rc runs all
                rc-scripts from /etc/rc.d
        changes formatting of ram1 (/opt) from 1024 byte to 4096 byte per inode
        edited /etc/mklinks.sh, so it makes no errors if an file is
                already in rootfs
        created directories /etc/prep, /etc/rc0.d and /etc/rc.d

01.04.2002 hs
    - converted variable next_rd to file /var/run/next_rd

01.04.2002 hs
    - added function call to rc.scripts

02.04.2002 jw5
    - introduced logical expression "copy_pending(string)" to allow
      checking of copy operations which depend on the value of a %
      variable
    - moved check whether we copied a file for each instance of
      eth_drv_% and masq_module_% to check/base.ext

03.04.2002 jw5
    - added match operator and index operator
    - introduced debug options for mkfli4l to get nicer debug output

04.04.2002 rr
    - Unpacking of opt.tgz now produces one '.' per extracted file and no file-list any more
    - EXT2-fs warning removed

07.04.2002 jw5
    - added "foreach i in var_n loop"
    - added temporary variables
    - logical expressions now behave as expected (evaluation of and
      is canceled after the first false term, or after the first true
      term)
    - we now first build a parse tree before actually start to
      execute a script

08.04.2002 jw5
    - sorting zip list

09.04.2002 rr
    - reworked rootfs (etc/rc) to use $PART_OPT also for defining the Ramdisk-Size
        'auto' selects Auto-Calculation of Size
        any number defines Ramdisk-Size
        numbers below 300 do auto-detect and adjust the calculation
        other entries than 'auto' and /[0-9]+/ select a Harddisk Partition

21.04.2002 fm

      to 70 sec
    - imond: added new commands fli4l-id & highscore

01.06.2002 tobig
    - removed portfw.sh & portfw-prep from opt/base.txt

      _then_

20.10.2002 jw5
    - removed manipulation of masq timeouts since the ipchain emulation
      doesn't support it. It set the following defaults instead:

      some colors, code cleanup, indention
    - and a bugfix for the menu, the last for today

25.11.2003 jw5
    - added support for config specific files, mkfli4l checks whether
    a file is under "$config_dir" and under "opt" and prefers the
    version under "$config_dir". mktgz.sh checks whether there are
    files under "$config_dir" and appends them to opt.tar.

12.12.2003 hs
    - removed eisa-nic ac3200, added r8169 and b44 network drivers

21.21.2003 george

27.12.2003 george
    - changed the dokumentation in sektion DNS Server.
    START_DNS has now three parameters: yes, ens and no. yes for the dnsmasq,
    ens for ens and no for no DNS Server.
    LISTENIP_N and LISTENIP_% are now in the config/base.txt. LISTENIP_N is the
    number of IP's dnsmasq should listen on, and LISTENIP_% are the IP's to
    listen on. ATTENTION: List in LISTENIP_% only IP's that are valid. The
    dnsmasq will not start, if you list one IP that is not valid!
    The mx-record now has a differend behavior when using ens or dnsmasq. The
    dnsmasq can only handle one mx-record, the ens several ones.

    - enabled all netfilter modules
13.06.2004 rresch
    - Variable PASSWORD is now crypted in rc.cfg
22.06.2004 lanspezi

    - added support of dual floppy boot (provided by Detlef
    Riekenberg; slightly adapted by jw5)
xx.08.04 fli4l team
    - extended packet filter configuration to allow references to
    other parts of the configuration; statements now allow references
    to:
        - IP_NET_x (IP_NET_x, IP_NET_x_IPADDR, IP_NET_x_DEV)
        - Hosts specified in HOSTS_x

    - renamed and split MASQUERADE_LIST into PRE- and
    POSTROUTING_LIST; prerouting_list provides a more fine grained
    configuration of portforwarding

    - other packets can now use the functions used to configure the
    packet filter more easily (see
    opt/files/usr/local/bin/setup-portfw-new.sh or vpn packet,
    opt/files/usr/local/bin/openvpn_fwrules-helper)

    - portfw may now be reconfigured on a running system since both
    prerouting and forward entries are generated by setup-portfw*.sh;
    simply shut down portfw, edit /etc/portfw*.conf, restart portfw

    - iptables upgraded - please be aware that fli4l currently only
    puts the absolutly required kernel modules (some are built into
    the kernel) and iptables matches and targets into the
    opt-archive. If you are trying to extend this functionality by
    using other target/matches you have to ensure that they are added
    to the opt-archive. Since targets (things which can be used with
    -j) and matches (things which can be used with -m) use the same
    names (targets use upper case names) targets are renamed to
    *.so.target (see opt/base.txt for examples)

    - upgraded busybox (currently 1.0-rc3 which is supposed to be the
    final version)

    - opt_inittab rewritten, you may now provide you own inittab if
    you need one

    - mkfli4l

      - provides subnet/samenet statements (can be used to check
      routes, see vpn package)

      - =~ saves the found subexpressions in array match_%

      - mkfli4l supports modification of the rootfs via rootfs: prefix
      in opt/package.txt (see boot_type usage in opt/base.txt)

    - rewrote boot scripts to allow more flexible support of different
    boot media - see BOOT_TYPE and opt/etc/boot.d for examples; fli4l
    is now able to boot from floppy, dual floppy (opt-archive split
    between two floppies), cd (see mkiso.sh, windows version still
    missing), hd (and similiar media like cf), network

(after 2.1.8-ut2004)

      interfaces, since the newer kernel > 2.6.16.62 use ACPI per default
    - busyboy halt command isn't anymore remapped to poweroff.
      use poweroff instead to power down the router.
    - as usual, documentation is pending, waiting for feedback

2009-06-15
    - re-introduce device creation in /etc/rc, since mdev is not able to create all needed devices

2009-06-29 abe
    - added optional variables: OPT_ADDMODULES, ADDMODULES
    - introduce opt ADDMODULES which is intended for debugging and testing
      purpose. The opt adds kernel modules to the opt archiv and loads the
      modules at boot time; see rc.100addmodules
      ADDMODULES contains the vertical slash '|' separated modules and
      parameter list; e.g.:
      ADDMODULES='processor|thermal|w83627hf addr=x00djhd|eeprom'

      as kernel_major=3.x and kernel_minor=y instead of kernel_major=2.6 and
      kernel_minor=40+x; please update your kernel version checks accordingly!
2012-04-27 kristov
    - archive generation (with the exception of compressing them) moved into
      mkfli4l; gen_init_* tools are not needed anymore and have been removed
2012-05-11 kristov
    - COMPRESS_KERNEL variable ('yes' or 'no') introduced, COMP_TYPE_KERNEL
      removed; use COMPRESS_KERNEL to choose between a compressed and an
      uncompressed kernel
    - COMPRESS_ROOTFS and COMPRESS_OPT ('yes' or 'no') introduced; use these
      variables to enable or disable the compression of the ROOTFS or OPT
      archive, respectively
    - COMPRESS_OPT='yes' is disallowed for boot types 'cd' and 'cdemul' and
      COMPRESS_ROOTFS='yes' is disallowed for boot type 'cd'; the OPT archive
      has always been uncompressed when using 'cd' or 'cdemul' but it was not
      possible to explicitly disable compression until now
    - COMP_TYPE_ROOTFS replaced by COMP_TYPE_ROOTFS_<kernel-version> and moved
      to the kernel packages; these variables may be defined to change the
      compression algorithm for the ROOTFS
